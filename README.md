> `calculaAngulo.c`: Program that generates a N number of vectors on a X and Y axis, calculates the center between then, and then translate those vectors into a new axis, using the calculated center. Then, it calculates the angle between each vector and the X axis.

> `QuickSort.c`: basic quicksort algorithm implementation in C.

> At the `Resumes` there are multiple theoric activities resuming fundamentals of programming, such as data structures, pointers, etc.

## Disclaimer
During the course, students were guided by the professor to elaborate the resumes by just **editing** the given slideshow. Therefore, all the `.pdf` original files are of the professor's authorship, and **just the modifications** -- quick explanations on each slide -- are my own.
